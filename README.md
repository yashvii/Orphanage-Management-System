# Orphange Management System 
Our project is based on orphan house database management system. The database contains all the information about the kids present in this orphanage, staff and ngoâ€™s which are connected to them. It also contains details about various facilities like education and health provided to them. Information about the families which are interested in adoption, and the various events organized to raise awareness and funds, all this information can be found in this database.
